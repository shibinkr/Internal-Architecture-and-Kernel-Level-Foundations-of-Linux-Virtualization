# Internal-Architecture-and-Kernel-Level-Foundations-of-Linux-Virtualization
A streamlined, developer-oriented overview of how Linux virtualization works across hardware, hypervisor, and kernel layers.This highlights essential concepts such as virtualization types, hypervisor design, hardware-assisted features, and the internal roles of KVM and QEMU. It emphasizes core kernel mechanisms for CPU and memory virtualization, device emulation, VirtIO, networking, storage paths, VM lifecycle operations, and security isolation. Focused on kernel developers and virtualization engineers, it provides a compact yet comprehensive map of the technologies, subsystems, and modern advancements driving Linux-based virtual machines.
